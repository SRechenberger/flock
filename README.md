# flock
A library to simulate the flocking behavior of programmable autonomous agents.
The agent's desing is based on
[Kilobot: A Low Cost Scalable Robot System for Collective Behavior](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/9367001/rubenstein_kilobotlow.pdf?sequence=1),
[A Minimalist Flocking Algorithm for Swarm Robots](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a640/6e3955b1572977addfb2fecb7730262f420e.pdf) and
[Self-Organized Flocking with a Mobile Robot Swarm](http://www.kovan.ceng.metu.edu.tr/pub/pdf/kobot_aamas08.pdf).

# Controlling a simulation
With a simulation running, you may *add* new *agents* by clicking **right**, where you want to have one and an *obstacle* by clicking **left**.
If you want to *pause* or *unpause* the simulation, press **space**, and **r** to reset everything.
